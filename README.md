# FastTest
It is a tool to do tests on web applications.
The mean goal is to be simple and fast.

While other tools are complex to configure and to start to use, FastTest is easier and simpler.

Look below how to set up and start to use:

## First
Put configuration in FastTest/config/test_config.php

## Second
You need to create a bootstrap file, look this example:

```php
<?php

include_once "../vendor/autoload.php";

$FastTest = new FastTest\FastTest('./config/test_config.php');
$FastTest->start();
```

After these steps, you can run:

```
php bootstrap.php 
```

### Done!

# Testing the FastTest
You need to go to folder  `FastTest/tests`

And run `php bootstrap.php`

The result is:

```
Success: test_0_get  
Success: test_0_get  
Success: test_0_post  
Success: test_0_post  
Success: test_0_put  
Success: test_0_put  
Success: test_0_patch  
Success: test_0_patch  
Success: test_0_delete
```
